It specifies the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. Each object, or instance, of a class possesses its own set of attribute values but shares the same structure and behavior defined by the class. This concept allows for the creation of modular and reusable code, facilitating the modeling of real-world entities within software applications."
